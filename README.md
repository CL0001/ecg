# Heart Abnormality Detection via ECG
This project was part of my internship during the years 2024/25. It serves as a walkthrough of how I created and trained a **PyTorch model** to detect common heart diseases or complications
based on ECG data, including abnormalities such as **1st-degree AV block (1dAVb)**, **right bundle branch block (RBBB)**, **left bundle branch block (LBBB)**, **sinus bradycardia (SB)**, **atrial fibrillation (AF)**, and **ST segment abnormalities (ST)**.

Additionally, this project includes an analysis of each step in the process, from data preprocessing to model training, explaining how the data was shaped for the model to work effectively.

⚠️ Note: This repository does not include a trained model or an ECG dataset due to privacy and ethical considerations. It is purely an academic analysis of the methodology used.

## Walkthrough
A detailed analysis and step-by-step guide are provided in the Jupyter notebooks included in this repository. Everything I’ve done, from initial testing to model building and training, is thoroughly documented there.
